### ‚úÖ **Digital-Only Tools:**

Tools with **electronic displays**, more accurate and easier to read:

| **Tool**                | **Use**                             |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Digital Vernier Caliper | Shows measurement in mm/inch (LCD)  |
| Digital Micrometer      | More precise readings (0.001 mm)    |
| Digital Height Gauge    | Measures vertical distance on plate |
| Digital Dial Indicator  | For CNC setup/alignment             |

### ‚úÖ **3D Probe Types (Touch Probes):**

Used in **CNC machines** to **automatically detect positions** (like zero points):

| **Tool**           | **Use**                            |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| CNC Touch Probe    | Finds X/Y/Z positions on part      |
| Tool Length Setter | Measures tool height automatically |
| 3D Edge Finder     | Locates part edges in 3 axes       |

Here is a **simple procedure for Prussian Blue Contact Test** (surface contact check):

---

### ‚úÖ **Tools Needed:**

* Prussian Blue (engineer‚Äôs blue paste)
* Surface plate (flat reference)
* Part to test
* Scraper or cloth

---

### üõ† **Steps:**

1. **Clean Both Surfaces**

   * Wipe dust, oil, and dirt. Use alcohol or acetone.

2. **Apply Prussian Blue**

   * Put **a thin, even layer** on the **reference surface** (not the part).
   * Use a roller or finger to spread lightly.

3. **Place the Part**

   * Gently place the test surface (e.g., machine bed) on the blue-coated surface.

4. **Rub or Slide Lightly**

   * Move the part **back and forth slightly** ‚Äî just a few cm.

5. **Lift and Inspect**

   * Check the bottom of the part:

     * **Blue spots = contact/high points**
     * **No blue = low/no contact**

6. **Scrape (if needed)**

   * If leveling: scrape only blue spots (high points), then repeat the test.

---

Repeat the process until you get **uniform blue contact** = flat surface.





üîπ What Happens:

    Prussian Blue sticks only to high (contact) points.

    Low/non-contact areas stay clean (no blue).

    But if blue was too thick or you rubbed too hard, smudges may appear on low spots.

üîß Fix / Best Practice:

    Apply very thin layer on the reference (accurate) surface only.

    Don't rub hard ‚Äî just light slide the test part.

    Clean test part with cloth + solvent (like kerosene/alcohol) if blue spreads.

    Scrape only marked blue spots (contact/high points).

Repeat the process until blue marks are evenly spread ‚Üí means full surface contact.

### ‚úÖ Apply Prussian Blue on the **reference surface** (good condition, master surface).

### üîπ Why?

* The blue must stay still and thin.
* The **test surface** will **move/slip** ‚Äî it will pick up the blue marks.

---

### Summary:

| Surface Type     | Apply Blue? | Reason                    |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ------------------------- |
| Good (reference) | ‚úÖ Yes       | Stable, even application  |
| Test surface     | ‚ùå No        | It must pick up the marks |

So always apply on the **flat reference**, and **rub the test part lightly** on top.
